      Exclusive Interview (assets/magazine.jpg)
      With Artist & Agent Provocateur (assets/magazine.jpg)
      Hassan Kayk X Upsiders (assets/magazine.jpg)
      "My reputation as an exhibitionist
      and a provocateur started a few years ago
      I called my show at the Serpentine (assets/serpentine.jpg)
      "Portrait of the artist as a young man
      on creatine"
      I set up a gym in the gallery (assets/gymp.jpg)
      I brought my powders and supplements (assets/powders.jpg)
      worked out every day as visitors watched (assets/visitors.jpg)
      my practice involves becoming the human rat
      the circus freak
      the zoo animal
      I put on display that which goes into our attempt 
      to infiltrate community
      press our connection with the weight (assets/press.jpg)
      of our bodies, the size 
      of our thoughts, lock in 
      belonging
      My obliques are the art (assets/obliques.jpg)
      My lats a primal Pollock (assets/lats.jpg)
      One evening, I took 3g of MDMA (assets/mdma.jpg)
      invited folks to observe the 6-hour trip (assets/craving.jpg)
      as my fibers longed to touch their skins (assets/craving.jpg)
      My body is another temple (assets/temple.jpg)
      where boyhood echoes (assets/temple.jpg)
      echoes (assets/temple.jpg)
      echoes (assets/temple.jpg)
      against walls of flesh
      craving sweat to quench its thirst
      and one day I will grow 
      large enough to be everywhere"
